								Fire doors are a crucial component of passive fire protection in almost all buildings. They safeguard escape routes and high-risk areas by containing the spread of fire. Due to wear and tear or misuse, these doors require regular inspections to ensure their functionality. Fire door inspections help identify necessary repairs and maintenance to minimize fire spread, providing occupants with extra time to escape. An effective inspection program includes routine visual checks and comprehensive surveys conducted by qualified professionals.

								<p>Fire door surveys have become a legal requirement in the UK due to changes in fire safety legislation aimed at improving building safety and reducing fire-related risks. This shift follows high-profile incidents, such as the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, which highlighted serious deficiencies in fire safety measures in many buildings. The Fire Safety Act 2021 and the Building Safety Act 2022 introduced stricter rules, focusing on ensuring that fire doors are properly installed, maintained, and inspected. Fire doors play a critical role in preventing the spread of fire and smoke, allowing occupants more time to evacuate safely and reducing the risk of structural damage.</p>
								<p>As part of this legislation, building owners, landlords, and responsible persons must conduct regular fire door surveys to assess the condition and functionality of fire doors. This includes checking for defects like damaged seals, improper fitting, or any other issues that could compromise the fire door’s effectiveness. Failure to comply can result in fines or prosecution, underscoring the seriousness of this requirement. Regular surveys ensure that fire doors meet the necessary safety standards, safeguarding occupants and property alike.</p>
